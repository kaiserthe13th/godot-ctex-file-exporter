# Godot CTEX File Exporter

This simple project allows you to simply take an exported CTEX file (usually you have to get this out of a PCK file) (I personally use: https://github.com/DmitriySalnikov/GodotPCKExplorer).

## How to Install?

1. By downloading it from the releases section
2. Compile it yourself by downloading this repository and then opening it in Godot 4.
